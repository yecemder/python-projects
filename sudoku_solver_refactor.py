# code idea:
# visit the board's empty (non-fixed) numbers (store them?) in some order
# start by placing a "1" in the first non-empty cell and check for violations
# if there are no violations (check constraints - row, column, box), advance to the next spot and fill in a 1
# if there are violations, advance the current number to 2
# keep incrementing until there are no violations
# if all 9 digits can't be in the spot, leave the spot blank, backtrack one spot and increment

# copy this into "board" to start a fresh new board
